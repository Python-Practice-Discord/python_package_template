# About This Template
This is the Python Package template for all projects developed and maintained by the Python Practice Discord
community. Our templates are maintained by the [Template Team](https://github.com/orgs/Python-Practice-Discord/teams/template-team), 
which is managed by Team Lead Morpheus636.

Special thanks to the following outside contributors and former team members for their work on these templates:
- PeterHoburg, Former Team Lead

## Using this template

(If you're just looking at this template, you can safely ignore everything above the line that says
"Remove this line and everything above it" - this is for the team lead to setup and it only needs to happen once
per project.)

The projects' name should be `lower_snake_case`. This should be the same name as the projects' root
directory.

* Find all instances of `replaceme` or `project name` and replace them with the project's name in these locations:
    * Change the name of `./src/project_template` to `./src/<project_name>`
    * README.md
    * pyproject.toml
* Change Github settings for the new repo:
    * Protect the main and staging branches with both actions.
    * Require pull request reviews before merging
        * require review from code owner
    * Require conversation resolution before merging
    * Require branches to be up to date before merging
    * Configure repository access:
       * Base access level for organization members should be `Read`
       * Group Project Team Leads should have `Maintain` permissions
       * The Project Team should have `Write` permissions
* Add project description in README.md
* Add usage instructions in README.md
* Add the core team and Team Lead information to `/docs/TEAM.md`
* Remove this line and everything above it.
