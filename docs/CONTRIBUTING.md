# How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to this project.
* [Finding and submitting bugs](TICKETS.md#submitting-bugs)
* [Working open tickets](TICKETS.md#working-a-ticket)
* [Adding documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md)

First, if you're in the Discord, make sure that you've joined the GitHub organization.

If you'd like to join the core project team, which we're limiting to 10 people, you can reach out to
a project manager or moderator and request to join. This will be first-come first-serve, and we will
remove inactive contributors from the team periodically to make space for new contributors.

If you can't get into the core team for whatever reason, or if you don't want to join the core team,
you are still welcome to fork the project repository, and create a pull request to merge your
changes with the rest of the project.

Please see the [Getting started developing](GETTING_STARTED_DEVELOPING.md) section of this readme for how to get this
project up and running.
